WISHLIST:

- Scores
	Maybe the game should calculate cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA1) of
	terrain files and use them to keep scores separate?  That is, if
	someone changes a terrain file, the old scores collected on that file
	should be rendered null and void.

- Configurable ANSI color

- A random terrain generator

- A random file picker from a terrain directory
