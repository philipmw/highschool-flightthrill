KNOWN ISSUES:

- No `configure` script.  Online documentation of autoconf/automake is too
  vague/incomplete/unintuitive for me to figure it out.  Submissions welcome.

- The Makefile is very amateurish, redundant, and does not correctly see when
  something has been already done; it insists on compiling everything from
  scratch every time.

- Occasionally the Y coordinate of the copter exhibits an off-by-one error
  while falling to its demise: the copter falls down one column using a
  neighboring column's terrain information, so it either falls "through" the
  stalagmite, or crashes before reaching the top of the stalagmite.  I've not
  been able to figure out why, but I haven't tried very hard.

- I am sure that at least one function in generic.cpp/generic.h is provided by
  standard C/C++ libraries.  It would be good to replace my own
  implementations thereof with standard ones.

- Sometimes it appears that the game is cheating because even though the
  copter goes right through shields, it does not activate them.  The problem
  is that the way the shield code works, it samples the background and if the
  copter has LANDED directly on a shield, it activates it.  However, if it
  passes it, then it gets ignored.  The way I've written it, the code is very
  simple and neat; sensing shields that the copter passed would probably be
  more complex and nasty.  It may even have to change the structure of the
  game loop.
