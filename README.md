This is an archive of _FlightThrill_, a console-based game I wrote in high school in spring/summer of 2004.

It's written in C++, as that was the only language I knew at the time, and uses ncurses.

The game is an imitation of [The Helicopter Game](http://www.seethru.co.uk/helicopter/).

This is archived just because I still have the files 12 years later, so why not immortalize them on GitHub?
